# Dimensionality-Reduction-for-Visualization

This project explores the application of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) for dimensionality reduction and visualization of the Fashion MNIST dataset, which consists of 70,000 grayscale images of clothing items categorized into 10 distinct classes. The primary objectives include reducing the dataset's dimensionality while preserving as much variance as possible, visualizing the principal components along with their explained variance, and applying t-SNE to the PCA-reduced data to reveal the clustering of different clothing categories in a two-dimensional space. The project also demonstrates the reconstruction of images from PCA components, allowing for an analysis of the reconstruction quality. To run the project, users need Python 3.x and the required libraries, including pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn. The Fashion MNIST dataset should be saved as fashion-mnist_test.csv in the same directory as the script. Users can clone the repository, run the provided Jupyter Notebook or Python script, and follow the instructions to visualize the PCA components, t-SNE results, and image reconstructions. The results showcase the effectiveness of PCA in capturing essential features of the images and provide insights into how different clothing categories cluster in a reduced two-dimensional space.
